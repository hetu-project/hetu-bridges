- 🔗 ERC-7683 Compatibility: Supports the ERC-7683 standard, providing enhanced flexibility and scalability for cross-chain transactions.

- 💸 Efficiency and Low Cost: Optimized protocol design reduces transaction costs and processing times.

- 🔒 Decentralization and Security: Maintained by a network of validators, ensuring decentralization and robust security.

- 🤖 AI-Powered Use Cases: Provides infrastructure support for decentralized AI (DeAI) and decentralized science (DeSci) applications.

## 🛠️ Cross-Chain Technology Overview

Hetu Bridge integrates Causality-Based Hyperscale Finality and ERC-7683 compatibility to deliver a robust cross-chain solution. Below is an overview of the core technical components and processes:
1. 🌐 Cross-Chain Communication Protocol

    User-Initiated Transactions: Users initiate cross-chain transactions on the source chain (e.g., Ethereum).

    Event Monitoring and Validation: Relayers monitor events on the source chain and relay transaction data to the target chain.

    Merkle Proof Verification: The target chain verifies transaction validity using Merkle Proofs.

    Asset Locking and Minting: Assets are locked on the source chain, and corresponding assets are minted on the target chain.

2. ⚙️ Causality-Based Hyperscale Finality

    Causal Ordering: Ensures logical consistency of cross-chain transactions using causality-based technology.

    Hyperscale Finality: Supports high-throughput transactions with a theoretical TPS exceeding 160,000.

3. 🔗 ERC-7683 Compatibility

    Flexible Transaction Interface: Enables seamless integration with multiple token standards and cross-chain protocols.

    Multi-Chain Interoperability: Facilitates interoperability with other blockchains through ERC-7683.

4. 🔒 Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)

    Verifiable Logical Clocks: Utilizes TEE to implement verifiable logical clocks, ensuring transparent and secure timestamping.

## 🔄 Technical Workflow
Step-by-Step Process:

    🚀 User Initiates Cross-Chain Transaction:

        A user initiates a cross-chain transaction on the source chain (e.g., Ethereum), specifying the target chain and recipient address.

    📡 Relayers Monitor and Relay Data:

        Relayers monitor cross-chain events on the source chain and relay transaction data to the target chain.

    🔒 Asset Locking:

        Assets are locked on the source chain to ensure the security of the cross-chain transaction.

    🔍 Merkle Proof Verification:

        The target chain verifies the transaction's validity using Merkle Proofs, ensuring data authenticity and integrity.

    ⏱️ Causal Ordering and Finality:

        Hetu Cross-Chain Bridge employs causality-based technology to order transactions, ensuring logical consistency.

        Hyperscale Finality enables rapid transaction confirmation and high throughput.

    🪙 Asset Minting:

        Corresponding assets are minted on the target chain and sent to the user's specified recipient address.

    🎉 User Receives Assets:

        The user receives the cross-chain assets on the target chain, completing the cross-chain process.

## 🛠️ How to Use
Step-by-Step Guide:

    🔗 Connect Wallet:

        Connect your Ethereum or other compatible blockchain wallet.

    🪙 Select Token:

        Choose the token you wish to transfer and the target chain.

    🚀 Initiate Transaction:

        Enter the recipient address and amount, then initiate the cross-chain transfer.

    ✅ Confirm Transaction:

        Confirm the transaction in your wallet and wait for the cross-chain bridge to process it.

    🎉 Completion:

        Once the transaction is complete, the tokens will appear on the target chain.
